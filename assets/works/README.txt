Drop your FlowEdge preview assets in this folder with exactly these names:

- flowedge-poster.jpg
- flowedge-scroll.webm
- flowedge-scroll.mp4

Notes:
- Keep filenames lowercase and extensions as shown.
- Poster should be a lightweight JPG (e.g., 1200–1600px wide).
- Videos: 3–4s loop, muted, optimized; provide both WebM (VP9/AV1) and MP4 (H.264) for broad browser support.
- After copying, refresh the page; the video auto-plays only when its card is active and visible.
